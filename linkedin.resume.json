      "summary": "I am a Software Engineer II at Pindrop currently focusing on full stack development based on a React + Rails stack. I specialize in identifying and solving complex problems by analyzing their domain and generalizing a solution. \n\nCurrently I have been working on rearchitecting a major application by breaking up a monolithic code base into a micro-service architecture. This is in addition to establishing and developing a design system for reusable components and a set of standards for programming patterns and state management paradigms to maximize performance in a reactive UI.\n\nI enjoy analyzing existing systems to learn how they function in order to identify how they can be improved; recently I have achieved this by completing the design and implementation of a build process which reduced the build time of our application by 80% (from 25 minutes to < 5). Additionally I have overhauled methods to extract data decreasing export time by over 98% (from 218 seconds to 3.5).\n\nIn addition to development I have experience with dev-ops workflows. I developed a CI application which I deprecated in favor of GoCD; I play the role of managing development workflows within my team.",
