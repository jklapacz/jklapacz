    "summary": "I'm a senior software engineer with a background in artificial intelligence and big data. I wish to work on data-driven systems with an uncompromising focus on performance (application-level as well as developer-experience).\n\nHaving worked at a number of startups I feel very comfortable amidst the chaos of a high-growth startup; the insights I bring from witnessing what happens when a tech startup takes off can be very valuable in helping avoid expensive mistakes.\n\nI have created applications from the ground up, broken apart legacy monolithic systems into microservices, created and maintained CI/CD pipelines, mentored and onboarded team-members and served as the subject matter expert on a number of (legacy) on-premise systems... at my core I am a technologist who strongly believes in automating what can be automated and am comfortable in almost any technical context.\n\nMy recent focus has turned towards working on tools which improve developer productivity and the developer experience and I am excited about the idea of utilizing AI/ML to improve the way developers can write code.",
